Installation
============

For users of Windows, MacOSX, and Linux, we recommend using Python's 
package management system, `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable>`_ .

Installation with ``pip``
::

    $ pip install Python-EasyGraph

`Conda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/>`_ works on Windows, MacOSX, and Linux, 
which serves millions of people managing package, dependency and environment for
Python and other languages.

To use EasyGraph in conda, you can create a new conda environment, which specifies Python version >=3.6, <3.8

Example installation with ``conda``
::
    $ conda create -n easygraph python=3.6
    $ conda activate easygraph
    $ conda install -c fudanmsn Python-EasyGraph
