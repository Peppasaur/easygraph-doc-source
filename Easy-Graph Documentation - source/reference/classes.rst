Graph Classes
=============

Easy Graph provides two types of graph classes, `Graph` and `DiGraph`, 
which is undirected graph and directed graph, respectively.

Both of these graph classes allow for any hashable Python objects as nodes, 
and edges are saved as Python dictionary type with custom key values and data.
