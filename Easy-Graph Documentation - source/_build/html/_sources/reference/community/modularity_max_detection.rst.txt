Community Detection - Modularity Greedy
=======================================
Find communities in graph using Clauset-Newman-Moore greedy modularity maximization. 
This method currently supports the Graph class.

Greedy modularity maximization begins with each node in its own community and
joins the pair of communities that most increases modularity until no such pair exists.
